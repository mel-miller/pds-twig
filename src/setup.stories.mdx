# Drupal Theme Setup

This will be a one-time process for configuring your theme to consume this toolkit. It is recommended that you build your theme from scratch and set the `base theme` to `stable`.

See the [PDS Demo](https://github.com/mel-miller/pds_demo) theme repository for setup and implementation examples.

<br />

## Create THEMENAME.libraries.yml file

See PDS Demo theme's [pds_demo.libraries.yml](https://github.com/mel-miller/pds_demo/blob/main/pds_demo.libraries.yml) for a complete example.

<br />

### Define CSS library

Add compiled css from PDS.

```
pds-css:
  css:
    theme:
      pds-drupal/css/pds-main.min.css: {}
```

### Define JS libraries

The `pds-drupal` package will ship with a compiled `pds-main.js` file as well as individual component js files.

Depending on use case, and size of js files, we may choose to implement a global js library that will load on each page, individual js libraries that can be attached on a case-by-case basis, or take a hybrid approach.

<br />

#### Global method

Add compiled js from PDS. Because most js code will be wrapped within a Drupal.behaviors object, `core/drupal` will always be a dependency.

```
pds-js:
  js:
    pds-drupal/js/pds-main.min.js: {}
  dependencies:
    - core/drupal
```

#### Individual method

Alternatively, we could choose to forgo a global js library and create individual libraries for each component that contains js. We would then attach the library to the Twig template on a per-component basis using Twig's `attach_library()` function.

For example, with the Modal component, add the following to THEMENAME.libraries.yml.

```
pds-modal:
  js:
    pds-drupal/js/modal/modal.js: {}
  dependencies:
    - core/drupal
```

Then add the following to the top of any Twig files that will be requiring this library.

```
{{ attach_library('THEMENAME/pds-modal') }}
```

#### Hybrid approach

We could choose to define each library separately, then apply some globally via the `THEMENAME.info.yml` file and some as needed via the `attach_library()` method.

<br />

## Create THEMENAME.info.yml file

Create this file as usual and then add the following PDS-specific items. See PDS Demo theme's [pds_demo.info.yml](https://github.com/mel-miller/pds_demo/blob/main/pds_demo.info.yml) for a complete example.

<br />

### Add global libraries

Make theme aware of any libraries (as defined in THEMENAME.libraries.yml) that we want to load on every page. For example:

```
libraries:
  - THEMENAME/pds-css
  - THEMENAME/pds-js
```

### Configure CKEditor to use PDS styles

```
ckeditor_stylesheets:
  - pds-drupal/css/pds-main.min.css
```

### Configure component namespace

Set "pds" as the Twig namspace to reference component Twig files.

```
component-libraries:
  pds:
    paths:
      - pds-drupal/twig
```

<br />

## Create THEMENAME.theme file

See PDS Demo theme's [pds_demo.theme](https://github.com/mel-miller/pds_demo/blob/main/pds_demo.theme) for a complete example.

### Create preprocess function to set common variables used across components

This is optional, but recommended, and will eliminate the need to set these variables each time you include a component that uses one.

```
 /**
 * Implements hook_preprocess().
 */
function THEMENAME_preprocess(array &$variables, $hook) {
  $theme_path = \Drupal::theme()->getActiveTheme()->getPath();

  // Global template variables.
  $variables['image_dir'] = $theme_path . '/pds-drupal/img';
  // More common variables TBD //
}

```

### Create preprocess function to set 'block_bundle' and 'block_id_num' variables

The `block_bundle` variable will be used in conjunction with the `block.html.twig` template to programatically set class names for custom block types. The `block_id_num` will be used when unique ids are needed in templates and scripts (currently used in the example Modal component).

```
/**
 * Implements HOOK_preprocess_block().
 */
function THEMENAME_preprocess_block(&$variables) {
  $content = $variables['elements']['content'];

  if (isset($content['#block_content']) && $content['#block_content'] instanceof BlockContentInterface) {
    // Sets extra vars for custom block types.
    $variables['block_bundle'] = $content['#block_content']->bundle();
    $variables['block_id_num'] = $content['#block_content']->id();
  }
}
```

### Create block theme suggestions function

This provides more fine-grained theme template suggestions which will aid in mapping components to custom block types.

```
/**
 * Implements HOOK_theme_suggestions_block_alter().
 */
function THEMENAME_theme_suggestions_block_alter(array &$suggestions, array $variables) {
  if (isset($variables['elements']['content']['#block_content'])) {
    array_splice($suggestions, 1, 0, 'block__' . $variables['elements']['content']['#block_content']->bundle());
  }
}
```

## block.html.twig

Use the default [block template](https://github.com/mel-miller/pds_demo/blob/main/templates/block/block.html.twig) provided by the PDS Demo theme.
