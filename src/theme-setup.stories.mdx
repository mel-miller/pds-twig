# Drupal Theme Setup

This will be a one-time process for integrating these components into a Drupal theme. See the [PDS Demo](https://github.com/mel-miller/pds_demo) theme repository for setup and implementation examples.

## composer.json

See PDS Demo theme's [composer.json](https://github.com/mel-miller/pds_demo/blob/main/composer.json) for a complete example.

<br />

### Configure "repositories" section

This will allow us to require any packages hosted on drupal.org, as well as requiring the `mel-miller/pds-drupal` assets package.

```
"repositories": [
  {
    "type": "composer",
    "url": "https://packages.drupal.org/8"
  },
  {
    "type": "vcs",
    "url": "https://github.com/mel-miller/pds-drupal.git"
  }
]
```

### Require Drupal [Components!](https://www.drupal.org/project/components) module

This will allow us to register a Twig namespace and directly import PDS twig templates into the theme templates.

```
composer require drupal/components
```

### Require [composer-installers-extender](https://packagist.org/packages/oomphinc/composer-installers-extender) package

This plugin sits on top of `composer/installers` and will allow us to customize intall paths for custom package types.

```
composer require oomphinc/composer-installers-extender
```

### Require [pds-drupal](https://github.com/mel-miller/pds-drupal) as a dev dependency

This package contains all components and assets necessary to use these components within a Drupal theme. We will be using the `dev-main` branch until tagged releases become available.

```
composer require --dev mel-miller/pds-drupal:dev-main
```

### Configure the "extra" section to accept "design-system" as a package type

This will install the `pds-drupal` package as its own subdirectory within the theme directory.

```
"extra": {
  "installer-types": [
    "design-system"
  ],
  "installer-paths": {
    "{$name}": [
      "type:design-system"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Add post-install and post-update scripts

This will keep your theme directory clean from unnecessary Drupal core files when running Composer commands from within the theme directory.

```
"scripts": {
  "post-install-cmd": [
    "rm -rf core/",
    "rm -rf modules/",
    "rm -rf profiles/",
    "rm -rf themes/",
    "rm -rf vendor/",
    "rm -rf web/",
    "rm -rf .gitattributes"
  ],
  "post-update-cmd": [
    "rm -rf core/",
    "rm -rf modules/",
    "rm -rf profiles/",
    "rm -rf themes/",
    "rm -rf vendor/",
    "rm -rf web/",
    "rm -rf .gitattributes"
  ]
}
```

## THEMENAME.libraries.yml

See PDS Demo theme's [pds_demo.libraries.yml](https://github.com/mel-miller/pds_demo/blob/main/pds_demo.libraries.yml) for a complete example.

### Define libraries

Add compiled css from PDS. (JS config coming soon)

```
global-css:
  css:
    theme:
      pds-drupal/css/pds-main.css: {}
```

## THEMENAME.info.yml

See PDS Demo theme's [pds_demo.info.yml](https://github.com/mel-miller/pds_demo/blob/main/pds_demo.info.yml) for a complete example.

### Add global libraries

Make theme aware of any global libraries

```
libraries:
  - THEMENAME/global-css
```

### Configure component namespace

Set "pds" as the Twig namspace to reference component Twig files.

```
component-libraries:
  pds:
    paths:
      - pds-drupal/twig
```

## THEMENAME.theme

See PDS Demo theme's [pds_demo.theme](https://github.com/mel-miller/pds_demo/blob/main/pds_demo.theme) for a complete example.

### Create preprocess function to set common variables used across components

This is optional, but will eliminate the need to set these variable each time you include a component.

```
 /**
 * Implements hook_preprocess().
 */
function THEMENAME_preprocess(array &$variables, $hook) {
  $theme_path = \Drupal::theme()->getActiveTheme()->getPath();

  // Global template variables.
  $variables['image_dir'] = $theme_path . '/pds-drupal/img';
  // More common variables TBD //
}

```

### Create preprocess function to set 'block_bundle' variable

This variable will be used in conjunction with the `block.html.twig` template to programatically set class names for custom block types.

```
/**
 * Implements HOOK_preprocess_block().
 */
function THEMENAME_preprocess_block(&$variables) {
  $content = $variables['elements']['content'];
  if (isset($content['#block_content']) && $content['#block_content'] instanceof BlockContentInterface) {
    // Sets block bundle variable for custom block types.
    $variables['block_bundle'] = $content['#block_content']->bundle();
  }
}
```

### Create block theme suggestions function

This provides more fine-grained theme template suggestions which will aid in mapping components to custom block types.

```
/**
 * Implements hook_theme_suggestions_block_alter().
 */
function THEMENAME_theme_suggestions_block_alter(array &$suggestions, array $variables) {
  if (isset($variables['elements']['content']['#block_content'])) {
    array_splice($suggestions, 1, 0, 'block__' . $variables['elements']['content']['#block_content']->bundle());
  }
}
```

## block.html.twig

Use the default [block template](https://github.com/mel-miller/pds_demo/blob/main/templates/block/block.html.twig) provided by the PDS Demo theme.
