# Drupal Theme Usage Examples

There are several ways to consume PDS styles and patterns within the Drupal theme.

## Inclusion within Twig templates (WIP)

Drupal template files must me stored in the `templates` directory at the root of the theme and must contain the `.html.twig` extension.

However, The Components! module was designed to be able to reference Twig files from outside of your theme's `templates` directory. During the theme setup, we configured the theme to look within the `pds-drupal` directory by referencing the `@pds` Twig namespace.

We can then use `include` (or `embed`, `extends`, etc...) to call the PDS Twig file from within the Drupal Twig file.

Here is an example of a Drupal theme template — `/templates/block/block--quote-block.html.twig` — that directly references a PDS Twig template.

```
{% extends "block.html.twig" %}

{% block content %}
  {% include "@pds/quote/quote.twig" with {
    quote_text: content.field_quote,
    quote_attribution: content.field_attribution,
    background_color: content.field_background_color|render|striptags|trim
  }%}
{% endblock %}
```

In this example we are extending the default `block.html.twig` template, but are replacing the contents of the `content` block from the original template with the contents of `quote.twig`.

We use `with` to map Drupal field values to the Twig variables as the template is being included. Alternatively, you can set the variables before including the template — either by using `{% set %}` earlier in the Twig template or by setting the variables globally with a preprocess function.
